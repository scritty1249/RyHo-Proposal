 <br>The goal of this documentation is to have a set of visual aids and clear outline following the process of updating the RyHo Rentals Google Drive structure.<br>After some discussion, it became clear that putting sensitive formulas integral to specific backend functions and dashboards in the same sheets as form responses would cause issues. Information is liable to be overwritten depending on when things are changes in the form linked to the spreadsheet.<br>The proposed structure I was tasked to create was to separate spreadsheets with formulas from sheets with form responses, and to remove any redundancies or broken functions as I found them. <br>* "Spreadsheets" are distinct from "Sheets", "Spreadsheets" refer to the file and "Sheets" are the individual ones contained within<br>See <a data-href="Reasoning for Changes" href="https://scritty1249.github.io/RyHo-Proposal/updating-drive-structure/reasoning-for-changes.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Reasoning for Changes</a> for details on what has been modified so far and why.<br>See <a data-href="TODO" href="https://scritty1249.github.io/RyHo-Proposal/updating-drive-structure/todo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">TODO</a> for what's been done and remaining progress.]]></description><link>https://scritty1249.github.io/RyHo-Proposal/updating-drive-structure/preface.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Updating Drive Structure/Preface.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kyle Tran]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2024 00:23:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[FIle Hierarchy Documentation]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The goal is to make it easier to restrict access to more sensitive information as needed, without compromising ease of use for key staff.<br><br>See <a data-href="FIle Hierarchy Documentation" href="https://scritty1249.github.io/RyHo-Proposal/updating-drive-structure/documentation/file-hierarchy-documentation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">FIle Hierarchy Documentation</a> for notes and documentation on the Drive structure.<br>Google Forms have all been separated into a designated folder following the path,<br>/Operations/Forms/
Copy<br>and have been separated further between forms used by those outside of the company, and those within.<br>/Operations/Forms/External/
/Operations/Forms/Company/
Copy<br>The corresponding Form Responses are stored in alongside the Forms/ folder in the path:<br>/Operations/Form Responses/
Copy<br>The structure each response is stored in mirrors the Forms they are linked to. This should make it easier to find the corresponding data for any Forms in the future.<br>
Form Response Spreadsheets only contain one Sheet- for the corresponding Form. The name of the Sheet must be "Form Responses".<br>/Operations/Form Responses/External/
/Operations/Form Responses/Company/
Copy<br>Dashboards/Interfaces have been separated into their own Spreadsheets. The data containing calculations for each are stored in,<br>/Operations/Information Technology/Dashboard &amp; Interface Calculations
Copy<br>Organizational Intent:<br>
<br>ALL information can be found in this central folder, no matter what. References(Shortcuts) to these files can be placed anywhere, but the sources should remain here.
<br>Keeping everything in one place should not only make things easier to find, but also simplify migrating data in the future
<br>Prevents accidental deletions. NOTHING should be deleted in these folders unless management gives the OK.<br>
Security Intent:
<br>When needed, view access to specific information can be easily revoked while retaining access to information critical to job functions. (Example- Currently, people are unable to interact with the Financial Data interface without full write access to all Timesheet logs. This could be very bad if someone were to tamper with the logs.)
<br><br>To maintain consistency and clarity the following names have been edited, alongside any connected spreadsheets and response folders:<br>
<br>Interview Availability -&gt; Interview Availability Form
<br>Applicant Scorecard -&gt; Applicant Scorecard Form
<br>Sales Report 2024 -&gt; Sales Report 2024 Form
<br>Disbursement Form -&gt; Advance Payment Disbursement Form
<br>Request Form -&gt; Advance Payment Request Form
<br>Reconciliation Form -&gt; Advance Payment Reconciliation Form
<br>I edited or added response validation to the following:<br>
<br>
Email formatting validation for Interview Availability Form, Onboarding Form and RyHo Rentals Application Form to reject any input that does not match the pattern of a valid email address. All email formatting validation follows the same Regular Expression pattern:
^([^\s]+)@([^\s]+)\.([^\s\.]+)$           &lt;- (Google uses the RE2, or "Golang" RegEx Engine)<br>
*This pattern specifically searches for any length of any non-space characters surrounding and between an ampersand and a period.

<br>
Lunch break length fields in the On-Site Checkout Form and Timesheet Form have been set to specifically take a duration value following the HH:MM:SS format. Field descriptions have been included in the affected forms to clarify the format.

<br>
Input fields for dollar amounts in the On-Site Checkout Form, Sales Report 2024 Form,  Equipment Liquidation Form, Disbursement Form, Request Form, and Reconciliation Form have been set to only accept number values at or greater than zero.

<br>Intent for Form Validation changes:<br>
<br>I have repeatedly seen formulas break from erroneous user input or lack of clarity in form descriptions (such as what units of time to use, hours vs minutes). I believe the problem can be rendered null be solved by indicating in the forms that only specific types of information are acceptable (Example: do not put words in a field that is supposed to be a number)
<br>More significant modifications:<br>
<br>The Timesheets Form question for "Lunch Duration" has been replaced with "Lunch Break?", and "Lunch In" and "Lunch Out" have been moved to a new section called "Lunch Break". The question "Did you pay for something that needs reimbursement?" has been moved to a new section called "Reimbursement?" but otherwise functions the same.
<br><br>To clarify for those editing sheets later, bottom borders in the header row following a color code based on content and intended purpose:<br>
<br>Orange - columns for users to change values (Example: checkboxes)
<br>Blue - columns that reference data from other Spreadsheets
<br>Yellow - columns that contain formulas which do not reference other spreadsheets
<br>Grey - other
<br>To clarify data being handled by formulas, all columns that use distinctive formatting (such as dollar formatting and time formatting) have their header's top border colored green.<br><br>To facilitate the function of dashboards and interfaces with minimal manual intervention, I have used Google Apps Scripts to automate the creation of certain rows.
